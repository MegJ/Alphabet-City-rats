        <p>On May 19, 2021, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas signed bill <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/pdf/SB00008H.pdf#navpanes=0">S.B.8</a>, also known as the “heartbeat bill”, into effect.  Under the law, any physician who performs an abortion after a fetal heartbeat has been detected is liable to be sued.  The law effectively bans abortions after 5-6 weeks of pregnancy, when fetal heartbeats are first detectable.  But what does that really mean If you are a woman in Texas?</p>

                            Gestational age is not calculated from the date of conception, it is calculated from the first day of a woman’s last menstrual cycle.  So before a fetus has even been concieved, the clock has already started.

                            Most pregnancy tests aren’t effective until after the first day of a women’s missed period.  If a woman takes a pregnancy test on the very first day she misses her period, the gestational age of her fetus will be 3-4 weeks, meaning she now has just 1-2 weeks to obtain an abortion.

                        Texas abortion law requires women to make two different in-person trips to one of
                        <a href = "https://needabortion.org/clinics/">just eleven licensed abortion providers</a>
                         in the state.  During the first of these trips, a woman must undergo a sonogram and recieve information that is often misleading about the medical risks of an abortion, including unproven claims about the risk of hemerage and death, certain cancers and infertility. The woman must also recieve counselling about adoption alternatives.

                <div class="column">
                    <p>
                        After waiting a full twenty-four hours, a woman can finally return to the same clinic they visited, and if the the doctor was unable to detect a fetal heartbat the woman can recieve an abortion.

                        After 5 weeks, only 1-2 weeks after most women find out they are pregnant, it is already too late to get an abortion.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Under the new Texas abortion laws, women who find themselves pregnant have only one to two weeks to make a decision to get an abortion, find and travel to a provider, make two seperate visits a full twenty-four hours apart.  The new law essentially makes abortion impossible in Texas, which is exactly what it was designed to do.
