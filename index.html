        <p>On May 19, 2021, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas signed bill <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/pdf/SB00008H.pdf#navpanes=0">S.B.8</a>, also known as the “heartbeat bill”, into effect.  Under the law, any physician who performs an abortion after a fetal heartbeat has been detected is liable to be sued.  The law effectively bans abortions after 5-6 weeks of pregnancy, when fetal heartbeats are first detectable.  But what does that really mean If you are a woman in Texas?</p>

                            Gestational age is not calculated from the date of conception, it is calculated from the first day of a woman’s last menstrual cycle.

                            Most pregnancy tests aren’t effective until after the first day of a women’s missed period.  If a woman takes a pregnancy test on the very first day she misses her period, the gestational age of her fetus will be 3-4 weeks, meaning she now has 1-2 weeks to obtain an abortion.

                        After 5 weeks, only 1-2 weeks after most women find out they are pregnant, it is already too late to get an abortion.

            “When you factor in the time it takes to confirm a pregnancy, consider your options and make a decision, schedule an appointment and comply with all the restrictions politicians have already put in place for patients and providers, a six-week ban essentially bans abortion outright.”
